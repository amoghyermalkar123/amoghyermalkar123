### Hi I am Amogh Yermalkar ðŸ‘‹

* I am primarily a backend developer and a systems engineer. I am from Pune, Maharashtra, India
* I am passionate about systems, networking, I am an engineer through and through because i love building cool stuff.
* I am a Go developer by day and a rust enthusiast by night.

### What am I working on currently?
* an application that lets you watch videos, listen to music in realtime. But the catch is you can do it with your friends, 
  at the same time, and the same content, and whoever is the creator of that room, controls playback which is reflected on all of 
  your friends devices.

* professionally i am building a hyper-local CDN.

### Any other thoughts..?
* I've recently realized i am always going to be a student, there's a ton of stuff to learn, so much knowledge to gain.
* as an engineer my ultimate goal is to build a timeless masterpiece.
* I love food.
